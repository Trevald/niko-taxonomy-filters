# Niko Taxonomy Filters
I was looking for a plugin that would add the possibility to filter the post list in admin based on available taxonomies for the current post type. Could only find snippets that neede to be modified per post type and taxonomy. This plugin works with native post types aswell as custom. It checks which taxonomies are registered for each post type and display only relevant taxonomies as filters.
